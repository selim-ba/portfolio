### Work Experience
#### AI Researcher (Internship) @ EDF 
_July 2024 - December 2024_
- Conducted a scientific review of deep learning algorithms for structural health monitoring, identifying potential applications of EDF.
- Developed a data processing pipeline with PyTorch, integrating computer vision models (such as YOLO, Mask R-CNN, and SegFormer).
- This pipeline handled raw data preprocessing, detected structural defects on concrete surfaces (dams, cooling towers), and predicted segmentation masks.
- Evaluated the model's prediction performance with classical metrics (IoU, F1-Score, Dice Coefficient)
- Tested GAN-based architectures for synthetic data generation to enhance existing datasets.

#### Data Analyst (Volunteer) @ Junior INSA Services
_November 2021 - November 2023_
- Analyzed business data collected through KPIs.
- Built interactive dashboards using Looker Studio and PowerBI.
