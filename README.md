## Work Experience
#### Machine Learning Engineer (Internship) @ [Société Générale CIB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale)
_April 2025 - September 2025_
- I am building an Early Warning System for credit risk (currently conducting research on machine learning and deep learning algorithms)


#### AI Researcher (Internship) @ [EDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lectricit%C3%A9_de_France)
_July 2024 - December 2024_
- Conducted a scientific review of deep learning algorithms for structural health monitoring, identifying potential applications for EDF.
- Developed a data processing pipeline with PyTorch, integrating computer vision models (such as YOLO, Mask R-CNN, and SegFormer).
- This pipeline handled raw data preprocessing, detected structural defects on concrete surfaces (dams, cooling towers), and predicted segmentation masks.
- Evaluated the model's prediction performance with classical metrics (IoU, F1-Score, Dice Coefficient)

#### Data Analyst (Volunteer) @ Junior INSA Services
_November 2021 - November 2023_
- Analyzed business data collected through KPIs.
- Built interactive dashboards using Looker Studio and PowerBI.
